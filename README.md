A repo to share about my Github Externship 2k21 Journey

## Application

During the Github externship application process, we need to prepare a project proposal. Our organization suggested researching about 5 existing consensus algorithms(blockchain) and derive your dream algorithm. I studied about 16 consensus algorithms.  I think that made the difference.
Yaa, I know when you compare 16 with 5, it's a large number. But when you compare it with the total number of existing Algorithms, 16 is a fraction of it. That was my realization about the vastness of blockchain Technology and my naivety in that field.
